# MyFirstBranch
# Welcome, Branch Navigator!

Congratulations on learning how to **switch branches** on GitHub!   
That’s a big milestone in your journey toward becoming a confident developer and collaborator.

##  What You Just Learned

By switching branches, you’ve unlocked the power to:

- Work on new features without touching the main codebase  
- Explore ideas safely  
- Collaborate with others in a clean, organized way  

Think of branches as alternate timelines where you can build, break, and rebuild—without disrupting the main project.

##  Next Steps: Explore the `resources` Branch

Now that you’ve successfully switched branches, welcome to the **`resources` branch**! 

Here, you’ll find:

-  All of the club's stream-specific learning and project materials 
-  General resources and templates for club activities 
- Guides, docs, and templates to boost your learning  

This branch is your personal resource hub. You’re encouraged to explore, copy, and experiment with anything you find useful here.

##  Keep Going!

Here’s where to grow next:

- Learn how to **create your own branches** (`git checkout -b my-branch`)  
- Understand how to **merge branches** into `main`  
- Try making a **pull request** (PR) to suggest changes  
- Explore how teams manage contributions using **issues**, **PRs**, and **branch protection**
- Understand local and remote branches- it saves a world of confusion later.

### Welcome aboard—and enjoy the resources!
